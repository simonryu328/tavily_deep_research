# üß± Deep Research From Scratch 

Deep research has broken out as one of the most popular agent applications. [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/), [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/built-multi-agent-research-system), [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-perplexity-deep-research), and [Google](https://gemini.google/overview/deep-research/?hl=en) all have deep research products that produce comprehensive reports using [various sources](https://www.anthropic.com/news/research) of context. There are also many [open](https://huggingface.co/blog/open-deep-research) [source](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-fullstack-langgraph-quickstart) implementations. We built an [open deep researcher](https://github.com/langchain-ai/open_deep_research) that is simple and configurable, allowing users to bring their own models, search tools, and MCP servers. In this repo, we'll build a deep researcher from scratch! Here is a map of the major pieces that we will build:

![overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b71727bd-0094-40c4-af5e-87cdb02123b4)

## üöÄ Quickstart 

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js and npx** (required for MCP server in notebook 3):
```bash
# Install Node.js (includes npx)
# On macOS with Homebrew:
brew install node

# On Ubuntu/Debian:
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Verify installation:
node --version
npx --version
```

- Ensure you're using Python 3.11 or later.
- This version is required for optimal compatibility with LangGraph.
```bash
python3 --version
```
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# Update PATH to use the new uv version
export PATH="/Users/$USER/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/langchain-ai/deep_research_from_scratch
cd deep_research_from_scratch
```

2. Install the package and dependencies (this automatically creates and manages the virtual environment):
```bash
uv sync
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys:
```bash
# Create .env file
touch .env
```

Add your API keys to the `.env` file:
```env
# Required for research agents with external search
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here

# Required for model usage
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here

# Optional: For evaluation and tracing
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your_langsmith_api_key_here
LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=deep_research_from_scratch
```

4. Run notebooks or code using uv:
```bash
# Run Jupyter notebooks directly
uv run jupyter notebook

# Or activate the virtual environment if preferred
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
jupyter notebook
```

## Background 

Research is an open‚Äëended task; the best strategy to answer a user request can‚Äôt be easily known in advance. Requests can require different research strategies and varying levels of search depth. Consider this request. 

[Agents](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/workflows/#agent) are well suited to research because they can flexibly apply different strategies, using intermediate results to guide their exploration. Open deep research uses an agent to conduct research as part of a three step process:

1. **Scope** ‚Äì clarify research scope
2. **Research** ‚Äì perform research
3. **Write** ‚Äì produce the final report

## üìù Organization 

This repo contains 5 tutorial notebooks that build a deep research system from scratch:

### üìö Tutorial Notebooks

#### 1. User Clarification and Brief Generation (`notebooks/1_scoping.ipynb`)
