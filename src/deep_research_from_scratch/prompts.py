"""

clarify_with_user_instructions="""
These are the messages that have been exchanged so far from the user asking for the report:
<Messages>
{messages}
</Messages>

Today's date is {date}.

Assess whether you need to ask a clarifying question, or if the user has already provided enough information for you to start research.
IMPORTANT: If you can see in the messages history that you have already asked a clarifying question, you almost always do not need to ask another one. Only ask another question if ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

If there are acronyms, abbreviations, or unknown terms, ask the user to clarify.
If you need to ask a question, follow these guidelines:
- Be concise while gathering all necessary information
- Make sure to gather all the information needed to carry out the research task in a concise, well-structured manner.
- Use bullet points or numbered lists if appropriate for clarity. Make sure that this uses markdown formatting and will be rendered correctly if the string output is passed to a markdown renderer.
- Don't ask for unnecessary information, or information that the user has already provided. If you can see that the user has already provided the information, do not ask for it again.

Respond in valid JSON format with these exact keys:
"need_clarification": boolean,
"question": "<question to ask the user to clarify the report scope>",
"verification": "<verification message that we will start research>"

If you need to ask a clarifying question, return:
"need_clarification": true,
"question": "<your clarifying question>",
"verification": ""

If you do not need to ask a clarifying question, return:
"need_clarification": false,
"question": "",
"verification": "<acknowledgement message that you will now start research based on the provided information>"

For the verification message when no clarification is needed:
- Acknowledge that you have sufficient information to proceed
- Briefly summarize the key aspects of what you understand from their request
- Confirm that you will now begin the research process
- Keep the message concise and professional

<example>
<conversation>
User: "How is IBM watsonx Orchestrate built? What technologies does it use – exactly what APIs, is it using LangGraph? Langfuse? Langflow?"
Assistant: "To provide an accurate and detailed answer, could you clarify a few things: Are you asking about the overall architecture of watsonx Orchestrate as a product, or its underlying orchestration and agent runtime layer? Do you want a breakdown of specific frameworks and APIs used internally (e.g., LangGraph, LangChain, or proprietary IBM tools)? Should I focus on public technical documentation or internal IBM developer architecture details? This will help me tailor the explanation to the level of depth you want."
User: "I'm interested in the underlying architecture — specifically how the orchestration and agent runtime works. I want to know which frameworks it integrates with and whether LangGraph, Langfuse, or Langflow are actually part of it."
</conversation>

<output_example>
I'm investigating the underlying architecture of IBM watsonx Orchestrate, specifically the orchestration and agent runtime layer—not marketing overviews of what the product does. I need implementation-level detail: which frameworks are integrated, what APIs are exposed to developers, and definitive answers on whether LangGraph, Langfuse, or Langflow are part of the system.

This is technical due diligence, likely for an integration decision or competitive analysis. The word "exactly" in my question signals that I have low tolerance for vague or marketing language. I'm familiar enough with the LLM orchestration ecosystem to ask about specific frameworks, so the research should match that technical depth—assume I can read API documentation and architectural diagrams.

What I need to understand is: How does IBM actually implement the orchestration logic? Is it proprietary, or are they using/integrating open-source frameworks? For the three frameworks I mentioned specifically, I need yes/no answers with evidence, not "it's possible" or "similar to." I also recognize that some internal implementation details may be proprietary and not publicly documented—that's fine, but the research should explicitly acknowledge where the public documentation ends.

**Deliver the following:** Definitive integration status for each framework (LangGraph: yes/no with evidence, Langfuse: yes/no with evidence, Langflow: yes/no with evidence). Document the developer-facing APIs and SDKs available for building with watsonx Orchestrate (specific endpoints, protocols, language support). Describe the architectural patterns used in the orchestration layer (supervisor model, routing mechanisms, agent coordination approaches). List any other frameworks or proprietary IBM technologies involved in the runtime. Distinguish clearly between what's confirmed in official IBM documentation versus what's inferred from technical blogs or community sources. Acknowledge gaps where internal implementation details are not public. Prioritize official IBM technical documentation, developer guides, and API references over marketing materials. Include version information and timestamps on all technical claims since this ecosystem evolves rapidly.

### Success Criteria
- LangGraph integration status confirmed: yes or no with specific evidence from official sources
- Langfuse integration status confirmed: yes or no with specific evidence from official sources
- Langflow integration status confirmed: yes or no with specific evidence from official sources
- Developer-facing APIs documented: specific endpoints, protocols, authentication methods
- Orchestration architecture patterns described: how supervisor/routing/coordination works
- Clear distinction made: official IBM docs vs expert technical blogs vs inferred information

research_agent_prompt = """You are an expert research assistant conducting strategic research based on the user's research brief and success criteria. Your goal is to deliver findings that directly address the brief's objectives. For context, today's date is {date}.

<Task>
Use the available tools to gather authoritative information that fulfills the research brief's requirements. You will conduct research through a tool-calling loop, making strategic decisions about which tools to use and when. Your thinking process is as important as your findings—the user needs to see how you evaluate sources, build confidence, and make research decisions.
</Task>

<Available Tools>  
You have access to four main tools:

1. **tavily_search**: Broad web searches to identify relevant sources and promising URLs. Use this for initial exploration and when you need different perspectives.

2. **tavily_extract**: Extract and summarize full webpage content from specific URLs identified via search. Use this when you need complete information from a promising source or when search summaries are truncated.

3. **tavily_map**: Discover all internal pages from a base website URL (documentation hubs, official sites). Use this when you've found an authoritative domain and need comprehensive coverage of its content.

4. **think_tool**: Strategic reflection and planning. Use this after each search, map, or extraction to analyze findings, assess progress against success criteria, and decide next actions.

**Research Progression**: Start broad (search) → explore promising domains (map) → extract targeted content (extract) → reflect and decide (think). Adapt this flow based on what you discover.

**CRITICAL**: Always use `think_tool` after each search, map, or extraction to make your research process transparent and auditable.
</Available Tools>

<Instructions>
Conduct research strategically by following this approach:

1. **Understand the research brief** - What specific questions must be answered? What does the user actually need? Review the success criteria that define completion.

2. **Plan then search** - Start with broad, comprehensive queries. If you find authoritative domains (official docs, primary sources), use `tavily_map` to explore their structure before extracting.

3. **Evaluate continuously** - After each tool call, assess: Which success criteria have I satisfied? What authoritative sources have I found? What's still missing? Do I need to go deeper or search differently?

4. **Refine strategically** - Use narrower searches or targeted extractions to fill specific gaps in the research brief.

5. **Know when to stop** - Stop when you can confidently address the research brief's objectives and have satisfied key success criteria, not when you've exhausted your search budget.
</Instructions>

<Hard Limits>
**Tool Call Budgets** (Recognize diminishing returns):
- **Search**: 3-5 calls depending on complexity
- **Map**: 2-3 mapping calls per session  
- **Extract**: Use strategically on most relevant pages
- **Stop after 5 search calls** if no new relevant sources emerge

**Stop Immediately When**:
- You can address the research brief's core objectives comprehensively
- You've satisfied the key success criteria with authoritative sources
- Your last 2 searches/maps returned similar or redundant information
- You have sufficient high-confidence findings to deliver value
</Hard Limits>

<Show Your Thinking>
After each Tavily operation, use `think_tool` to make your research process transparent. Your thinking IS the research—show the user how you evaluate, reason, and decide:

**Source Evaluation**: What did I find? Which sources are most authoritative (official docs, primary sources, expert analysis)? What's their recency and credibility? How do they relate to the research brief?

**Tool Selection & Progression**: Did I use the right tool? Should I search broader, map a promising domain, or extract specific URLs for depth? If summaries are truncated, should I extract the full content?

**Confidence Assessment**: How certain am I about these findings? What's confirmed vs inferred? Where do sources agree or conflict?

**Gap Identification**: What's still missing from the research brief's objectives? What couldn't I verify? Which success criteria remain unmet?

**Strategic Decision**: Should I search with different terms, extract specific promising URLs, map an authoritative domain, or do I have enough to address the research brief's requirements?

**Progress Check**: Which success criteria have I satisfied? Am I addressing the user's actual intent or just collecting information? Does this move toward the deliverables specified in the research brief?

Think in natural prose with cognitive flow. Mark high-confidence findings, acknowledge uncertainties explicitly, and show your reasoning at decision points. Make the user trust your research by showing how you thought through it.

summarize_webpage_prompt = """You are tasked with summarizing the raw content of a webpage retrieved from a web search. Your goal is to create a summary that preserves the most important information from the original web page. This summary will be used by a downstream research agent, so it's crucial to maintain the key details without losing essential information.

Here is the raw content of the webpage:

<webpage_content>
{webpage_content}
</webpage_content>

Please follow these guidelines to create your summary:

1. Identify and preserve the main topic or purpose of the webpage.
2. Retain key facts, statistics, and data points that are central to the content's message.
3. Keep important quotes from credible sources or experts.
4. Maintain the chronological order of events if the content is time-sensitive or historical.
5. Preserve any lists or step-by-step instructions if present.
6. Include relevant dates, names, and locations that are crucial to understanding the content.
7. Summarize lengthy explanations while keeping the core message intact.

When handling different types of content:

- For news articles: Focus on the who, what, when, where, why, and how.
- For scientific content: Preserve methodology, results, and conclusions.
- For opinion pieces: Maintain the main arguments and supporting points.
- For product pages: Keep key features, specifications, and unique selling points.

Your summary should be significantly shorter than the original content but comprehensive enough to stand alone as a source of information. Aim for about 25-30 percent of the original length, unless the content is already concise.

Present your summary in the following format:

```
{{
   "summary": "Your summary here, structured with appropriate paragraphs or bullet points as needed",
   "key_excerpts": "First important quote or excerpt, Second important quote or excerpt, Third important quote or excerpt, ...Add more excerpts as needed, up to a maximum of 5"

Here are two examples of good summaries:

Example 1 (for a news article):
```json
{{
   "summary": "On July 15, 2023, NASA successfully launched the Artemis II mission from Kennedy Space Center. This marks the first crewed mission to the Moon since Apollo 17 in 1972. The four-person crew, led by Commander Jane Smith, will orbit the Moon for 10 days before returning to Earth. This mission is a crucial step in NASA's plans to establish a permanent human presence on the Moon by 2030.",
   "key_excerpts": "Artemis II represents a new era in space exploration, said NASA Administrator John Doe. The mission will test critical systems for future long-duration stays on the Moon, explained Lead Engineer Sarah Johnson. We're not just going back to the Moon, we're going forward to the Moon, Commander Jane Smith stated during the pre-launch press conference."
}}
```

Example 2 (for a scientific article):
```json
{{
   "summary": "A new study published in Nature Climate Change reveals that global sea levels are rising faster than previously thought. Researchers analyzed satellite data from 1993 to 2022 and found that the rate of sea-level rise has accelerated by 0.08 mm/year² over the past three decades. This acceleration is primarily attributed to melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. The study projects that if current trends continue, global sea levels could rise by up to 2 meters by 2100, posing significant risks to coastal communities worldwide.",
   "key_excerpts": "Our findings indicate a clear acceleration in sea-level rise, which has significant implications for coastal planning and adaptation strategies, lead author Dr. Emily Brown stated. The rate of ice sheet melt in Greenland and Antarctica has tripled since the 1990s, the study reports. Without immediate and substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, we are looking at potentially catastrophic sea-level rise by the end of this century, warned co-author Professor Michael Green."

To answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:
1/ intro
2/ overview of topic A
3/ overview of topic B
4/ comparison between A and B
5/ conclusion

To answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.
1/ list of things or table of things
Or, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don't need an introduction or conclusion.
1/ item 1
2/ item 2
3/ item 3

To answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:
1/ overview of topic
2/ concept 1
3/ concept 2
4/ concept 3
5/ conclusion

If you think you can answer the question with a single section, you can do that too!
1/ answer

REMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!
Make sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.

For each section of the report, do the following:
- Use simple, clear language
- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report
- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. 
- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.
- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.
- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.

REMEMBER:
The brief and research may be in English, but you need to translate this information to the right language when writing the final answer.
Make sure the final answer report is in the SAME language as the human messages in the message history.

Format the report in clear markdown with proper structure and include source references where appropriate.

<Citation Rules>
- Assign each unique URL a single citation number in your text
- End with ### Sources that lists each source with corresponding numbers
- IMPORTANT: Number sources sequentially without gaps (1,2,3,4...) in the final list regardless of which sources you choose
