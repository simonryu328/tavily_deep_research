## **Tavily Deep Research Agent**

### **Executive Summary**

This project extends the original LangChain "Deep Research From Scratch" repository with architectural improvements focused on **tool-informed research continuity** and **strategic research planning**. 

The original repository demonstrated a three-phase architecture (Scope ‚Üí Research ‚Üí Write) with multi-agent coordination using a supervisor pattern and basic Tavily integration (single `tavily_search` tool). 

The main changes include:

1. **Tavily API Expansion**: Expanding from single `tavily_search` to a strategic three-tool workflow (`tavily_search` ‚Üí `tavily_map` ‚Üí `tavily_extract`)
2. **Strategic Brief Generation**: Transforming research brief generation from simple questions to comprehensive strategic briefs with success criteria
3. **Success Criteria Tracking**: Implementing automated success criteria tracking for research completion evaluation

---

## **1. Tavily API Expansion**

### **Original Implementation**
```python
# Original: Single search tool
tools = [tavily_search, think_tool]
```

### **Enhanced Implementation**
```python
# Enhanced: Multi-tool strategic workflow
tools = [tavily_search, tavily_extract, tavily_map, think_tool]
```

### **Strategic Research Pattern**

**Before**: `Search ‚Üí Think ‚Üí Search ‚Üí Think` (limited extraction and search depth)

**After**: `Search ‚Üí Map ‚Üí Extract ‚Üí Think` (comprehensive exploration)

#### **New Tool Capabilities**

- **`tavily_extract`**: Extract and summarize full webpage content from specific URLs for deep content analysis
- **`tavily_map`**: Discover all internal pages from authoritative domains for systematic exploration

#### **Research Workflow Evolution**

The expanded toolkit enables a research progression:

```
üîç` Search (broad exploration) 
    ‚Üì
üó∫Ô∏è Map (systematic domain exploration)
    ‚Üì  
üìÑ Extract (deep content analysis)
    ‚Üì
üß† Think (strategic evaluation)
```

This pattern enables:
- **Broad exploration** with comprehensive searches
- **Systematic domain mapping** of authoritative sources  
- **Targeted content extraction** for deep analysis
- **Context continuity** throughout the research process

## **2. Research Brief Generation: From Questions to Strategic Briefs**

### **Original Prompt** (Before Enhancement)

```python
transform_messages_into_research_topic_prompt = """
Your job is to translate these messages into a more detailed and concrete research question that will be used to guide the research.

You will return a single research question that will be used to guide the research.
"""
```

**Limitations**: Single question focus, no strategic planning, no success criteria, limited context interpretation

### **Enhanced Strategic Brief Generation** (Commit: `1d3f1f4`)

```python
transform_messages_into_research_topic_prompt = """
<role>
You are an expert research strategist who transforms conversations into comprehensive, actionable research briefs that demonstrate deep understanding of user intent and strategic planning.
</role>

<task>
Generate a strategic research brief from the conversation that interprets underlying needs, frames concrete objectives, identifies constraints, specifies deliverables, and acknowledges uncertainties.
</task>
```

### **Strategic Dimensions**

1. **Intent Understanding**: What is the user trying to accomplish?
2. **Constraint Identification**: Hard requirements vs. soft preferences
3. **Context Synthesis**: Timing, urgency, domain expertise, risk factors
4. **Deliverable Clarity**: Specific, actionable outputs with imperative framing
5. **Source Standards**: What's authoritative? What needs verification?
6. **Ethical Boundaries**: Appropriate disclaimers and professional consultation notes
7. **Uncertainty**: What's confirmed vs. inferred vs. assumed?

### **Example Transformation**

**Before**: "Research IBM watsonx Orchestrate architecture"

**After**: 
```
I'm investigating the underlying architecture of IBM watsonx Orchestrate, specifically the orchestration and agent runtime layer‚Äînot marketing overviews of what the product does. I need implementation-level detail: which frameworks are integrated, what APIs are exposed to developers, and definitive answers on whether LangGraph, Langfuse, or Langflow are part of the system.

**Deliver the following:** Definitive integration status for each framework (LangGraph: yes/no with evidence, Langfuse: yes/no with evidence, Langflow: yes/no with evidence). Document the developer-facing APIs and SDKs available for building with watsonx Orchestrate...

### Success Criteria
- LangGraph integration status confirmed: yes or no with specific evidence from official sources
- Langfuse integration status confirmed: yes or no with specific evidence from official sources
- Langflow integration status confirmed: yes or no with specific evidence from official sources
- Developer-facing APIs documented: specific endpoints, protocols, authentication methods
- Orchestration architecture patterns described: how supervisor/routing/coordination works
- Clear distinction made: official IBM docs vs expert technical blogs vs inferred information
```

## **3. Success Criteria Implementation: Research Completion Tracking**

### **State Management Enhancement** (Commit: `f5f60b9`)

```python
class AgentState(MessagesState):
    # Use dictionary for key‚Äìvalue success criteria tracking
    success_criteria: Annotated[Dict[str, bool], operator.or_] = Field(default_factory=dict)
```

### **Success Criteria Parsing** (Commit: `b321655`)

```python
def parse_success_criteria(state: AgentState):
    """
    Extracts success criteria from the research brief and updates the AgentState
    with a dictionary mapping each criterion to False (not yet evaluated).
    """
    brief = state.get("research_brief", "")
    criteria_dict = {}
    
    # Extract text after "Success Criteria" section
    match = re.search(r"Success Criteria(.*)", brief, flags=re.IGNORECASE | re.DOTALL)
    if match:
        section_text = match.group(1).strip()
        # Capture each bullet (‚Ä¢ or -) line as an individual criterion
        lines = re.findall(r"[‚Ä¢\-]\s*(.+)", section_text)
        for line in lines:
            clean_line = re.sub(r"\s+", " ", line).strip()
            if clean_line:
                criteria_dict[clean_line] = False
    
    return {"success_criteria": criteria_dict}
```

### **Implementation Status**

**Implemented**: Success criteria extraction, dictionary-based tracking, integration with research brief generation

**Next Steps**: Real-time evaluation, dynamic completion logic, progress visualization

## **4. Research Agent Prompt Evolution: Strategic Research Guidance**

### **Original Prompt Focus**
```python
research_agent_prompt = """You are a research assistant conducting research on the user's input topic.
Your job is to use tools to gather information about the user's input topic.
```

### **Enhanced Strategic Prompt** (Commit: `beffaa5`)

```python
research_agent_prompt = """You are an expert research assistant conducting strategic research based on the user's research brief and success criteria. Your goal is to deliver findings that directly address the brief's objectives.
```

### **Key Improvements**

1. **Brief-Driven Research**: Research guided by strategic brief rather than simple topic
2. **Success Criteria Integration**: Research decisions informed by completion criteria
3. **Tool Selection Strategy**: Clear guidance on when to use each tool
4. **Transparent Thinking**: Emphasis on making research process auditable

### **Tool Usage Guidance Evolution**

**Before**: Generic tool calling with basic search patterns

**After**: Strategic tool progression with clear decision criteria:

```python
**Research Progression**: Start broad (search) ‚Üí explore promising domains (map) ‚Üí extract targeted content (extract) ‚Üí reflect and decide (think). Adapt this flow based on what you discover.

**CRITICAL**: Always use `think_tool` after each search, map, or extraction to make your research process transparent and auditable.
```
